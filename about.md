The Incunabula at KU Project (InK) aims to both make visible to the public - researchers, faculty, students and other interested parties - the breadth of the library's incunabula collection as well as to emphasize the uniqueness of the collection by making available online the in-depth bibliographic analysis of three of the Spencer Library's rarest early printed books. Part of the data we aim to showcase concerns certain trends in collection practices. We propose to do this by mapping the library's early printed books according to a few different parameters and then including these maps as part of our static web site. A cartographical visualization is appropriate in this case because it is able to communicate various data at a glance: the place of publication, the language in which the book is printed and the year in which the book is published.
