This project was first headed by Erik Alder, Christi Ivers, and Heather Tennison. We would like to acknowledge also the assistance of Spencer Library curators Elspeth Healey and Karen Cook. We also thank Élika Ortega for training us in the ways of the digital humanist and Erik Radio for giving us access to KU’s online record of its incunabula. Thank you also to Patrizio Ceccagnoli and Isidro Rivera for lending us your expertise for this project.
